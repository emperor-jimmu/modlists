== Quality of Life

Convenience and automation that remove busywork: faster actions, smarter defaults, and information that should have been visible anyway. The stated goal is fewer clicks and fewer surprises - not easier battles. Check each card's Impact field for exactly what it changes.

// The placeholder below shows the format. Replace it with one card per supplied mod.
