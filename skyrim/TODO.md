## Review next

- **Dragon Bard Ultimate (151231)** — REJECTED. Skyrim's Got Talent is locked as the bard gameplay baseline. Dragon Bard Ultimate adds playable instruments + singing with custom animations but conflicts with the locked baseline. Heavy Pandora maintenance cost for niche value. Revisit only if Bard College expansion becomes a priority.

- Test Beards of Power under CS lighting for neck clipping.
- Evaluate finding-derkeethus/Bethesda FormID fix with xEdit for unresolved conflicts.
- Verify New Beast Feet meshes don't clip with beast-race footwear from Immersive Armors or other armor packs.
- Test HDT-SMP Vanilla Armors performance overhead in combat with multiple NPCs wearing physics-enabled armor.
- **The Ancient Falmer** — Locked as Snow Elf race baseline. Proceed with: HPH patch verification, dialogue framework compatibility check, alternate start support (Skyrim Unbound Reborn), and RaceCompatibility integration into the Foundations section.
- **Frozen in Time** — Now unblocked (Ancient Falmer locked). Verify no DynDOLOD or navmesh conflicts with Ancient Falmer Ruins. Check LoTD display patch availability.
- **Occiglacies** — Now unblocked (Ancient Falmer locked). Verify LoTD display patch (mod 64117) compatibility with current LoTD version.
- **Elven Chainmail** (mod 14978) — Verify 1.6.1170 compatibility. LE-era port last updated Jan 2018. May need mesh/texture porting work. Alternatives: Archaic Elven Armaments (152679).
- **Vampire follower evaluation** — Now unblocked (NPC baseline confirmed: comprehensive + targeted add-ons). Evaluate 4 vampire followers: Silas (Bosmer vampire, ESL, uses player body/skins), Koemia (custom-voiced, DBVO patch, mod 101405), Voira (Pandorable's, 1088 end., mod 42708), Dumitra (Altmer custom-voiced 600+ lines, mod 147787). Evaluate against comprehensive NPC baseline for visual consistency.
- **DF Edit NPC face replacers (11 mods)** — Now unblocked (NPC baseline confirmed). Individual Distinct Faces edits for Camilla (177048), Rayya (179325), Angi (178488), Sapphire (161017), Saadia (169287), Jenassa (164775), Aranea (176413), Brelyna (166402), Eola (161817), Fura Bloodmouth (171382), Ysolda (169910). Some are SkyPatched, some ESP-based. Will selectively override the comprehensive NPC baseline.
- **Vampire Clans and Bloodlines (37517)** — DEFERRED. Evaluate after combat stack and perk overhaul are stable. CS compat, LoTD patches, third-person/gamepad. Conflicts possible with Sacrosanct and Open World Loot.
- **Natural Learning (148990)** — Now unblocked (Adamant locked as perk baseline). Passive skill tree/perk system by Zzyxzz. Requires SkyPatcher + SkyPatcher Keyword Framework. Evaluate: does the passive tree augment or conflict with the XP/leveling dial (Experience + Static Skill Leveling + Static with Hard Threat)? AP patch available (162537). Does NOT replace Adamant — augments it.
- **Singalongs of Skyrim (129812)** — DEFERRED to verification. ESL-flagged, ~1,000 end, AI-Generated tag. Bard singalong dialogue + original songs + 12 instrumental tunes. Verify dialogue overlap with locked `Skyrim's Got Talent` (106106) + `BA Bard Songs` (audio.md:18) before adopting.
- **Headshots Kill SKSE (181461)** — REJECTED (for now). Ranged headshot/OHKO mod. Precision + SKSE Menu Framework reqs already in stack, but ranged lethality fights the difficulty dial (Arena / Simply Balanced / KYE2). 112 end, AI-Generated tag, crash-fix history (1.11/1.41). Revisit only if ranged combat needs headshot depth.
- **College of Winterhold Bridge Lights (182546)** — REJECTED. Built for the author's own "Ultimate College of Winterhold"; list locks the Obscure's + JK's College sub-stack, so bridge geometry differs. 32 end. Misalignment risk not worth it.
- Speed of Strolling - Travel Overhaul - <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/183198> — **Redundant.** Terrain-based movement speed overlaps `S.M.C.` (97204, third-person.md:50, locked movement) slope-speed/per-state tuning + `Walk Speed Tuner` (179215) candidate. Do not add.
- New Tavern Music - <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113349> — **Redundant/optional.** Tavern band music overlaps `Melodies of Civilization` tavern tracks (audio.md:15); add only via Synthesis music merge.
